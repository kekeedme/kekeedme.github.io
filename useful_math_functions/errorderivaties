Do know that you cannot choose the stepsize of numerical derivatives to be arbitrarily small
Typically, it is recommended to choose a stepsize equal to 2 time the square root of machine
epsilon (eps).
Numpy uses float32, the corresponding machine eps is of the order 10**(-19),
hence I do not recommend going lower than 0.0007 for derivative of order 4. But for higher
orders, estimates are different
But very importantly, this is numerics and not analytical, hence your stepsize is inherently
limited to the spacing between your data points as well.
