## 2-Level System (Oscillation forever) Part 1
<div align="justify">
In this section, we explore the dynamics of a 
two-level quantum system. 
Specifically, it consists of a system 
in which all other degrees of freedom are ignored, 
and we are only interested in the transition 
between two states of the system 
(e.g two electronic states, or two possible spin states, or two possible molecular configurations etc…). 
This consideration means that for our problem,
we need two basis states, 
which will span the entire 2-dimensional complex space in which our system “exists”. 
Hence the wavefunction describing our system will 
be a linear combination of these 
two basis states.</div>

#### We begin by describing our basis states:

$\phi_1(r)$ and $\phi_2(r)$  are orthonormal states, that is:

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{1}
\langle \phi_1|\phi_1 \rangle=\langle \phi_2|\phi_2 \rangle=1 \\
\tag{2}
\langle \phi_1|\phi_2 \rangle=\langle \phi_2|\phi_1\rangle=0
\end{align}
$$

(Recall that 
$\langle\phi_1|\phi_1\rangle=\int \phi_1^*\left(r\right)\phi_1\left(r\right)dr=1$ , 
with $\phi_1^{*}$ complex conjugate of $\phi_1$ )
