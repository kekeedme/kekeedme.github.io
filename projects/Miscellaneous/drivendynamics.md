# Perturbative and Exact Treatment of Driven Transitions Between Quantum States

We are interested in understanding how a quantum system evolves if it is subjected to a driving frequency that induces a transition from 
one initial state to a final state. Typically, such a problem can be studied in the context of a time-dependent perturbation theory. In fact, 
this is possible even if the perturbation itself is time-independent. The reason is that the perturbation will influence the system during
a finite time interval. The question becomes, does the perturbation causes a transition from a state to another (or to several)? In certain 
cases, the problem can be treated exactly (i.e. without the use of perturbation theory), and it is very informative to study the slight 
differences in treating the problem exactly or pertubatively as this gives us more insight into the approximations used in the pertubative 
case.  

We will look at a two-level system driven by a time-dependent oscillating field. We will describe the transition induced by this field using
first-order perturbation theory, and we will obtain an expression for the rate of the transition. We will then look at an exact treatment 
of this problem and compare the results with those obtained in the perturbation theory treatment.
