# Three Flavors of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

A harmonic oscillator is a physical system in which, the force required to restore the system to its equilibrium 
position is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium. Classically, the harmonic oscillator model is usually applied
to the oscillation about an equilibrium point of a mass attached to a spring.
In one dimension, if the equilibrium position is $x=0$, 
the restoring force will then be: 

\begin{align}
\tag{1}
F_{x}=-kx
\end{align}

The force being conservative (meaning that the work done by the force is independent of path, only dependent on the initial
and final position), we can determine the potential energy stored in the oscillator for a given displacement $x$.
