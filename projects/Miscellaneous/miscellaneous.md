On this page, you will find lecture slides, notes or paper style documents I have written
to explain a concept in quantum mechanics, or a mathematical concept that is then applied to a 
physical chemistry or quantum concept. I created these documents as I was studying the concepts presented 
therein myself. I made these documents as a way to better understand what I was learning,
make them presentable such that someone else could use, in the hopes that they would be useful to
their own self-study. 
I started doing this during the first covid lockdown. Typically, when one makes slides for a presentation,
they include the institution to which they belong on the first page. Since I was home when I started, 
I put Lakay Institute of Technology. It is a bit of a joke because Lakay is the Haitian creole word for 
Home. So I kept doing that for the rest of the slides.
