# Magnetic Moment of the Electron
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
We can develop an expression for the magnetic moment of the electron by starting from the magnetic moment generated by a current loop.
The magnetic moment, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, is an indication of the 'strength' of the magnetic field generated by the current loop.
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is proportional to the number of loops $N$, the current $I$ going through the loop, and the area of the loop $A$. Hence, 
the units of the magnetic moments are amperes meter squared $[Am^2]$. We have the following relations:

$$
\begin{align}
    \tag{1}
     &\boldsymbol{\mu}=IA\\
    \tag{2}
     &A=\pi r^2\\
    \tag{3}
        &I=\frac{e}{t}
\end{align}
$$

If we consider the case of an electron going around a nucleus, we need a better expression for $I$ in this case. One that relates $I$ to the velocity of the electron, and the radius of its trajectory. This line of thought will make it clear that the magnetic moment of the electron is related to its angular 
momentum.
Suppose the electron is going around the nucleus with velocity $v$, in a circular orbit. 
Then the period $T$ is the time it takes to travel one complete revolution, $2\pi r$. 
Hence, $T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}$. 
So we can write $I=\frac{ev}{2\pi r}$. 
We recall that the classical magnitude of angular momentum is given by: $L=mvr$. We can express $I$, 
and thus the magnitude of $\mathbf{\mu}$, as a function of $L$. Indeed, we obtain:

$$
\begin{align}
    &I=\frac{ev}{2\pi r}\nonumber\\
    \\
    &\boldsymbol{\mu}=\frac{ev}{2\pi r}\pi r^2\nonumber\\
    \\
    \tag{4}
    &\boldsymbol{\mu_{L}}=\frac{eL}{2m}
\end{align}
$$

Equation 4 is the magnitude of the magnetic moment as it relates to the total angular momentum.
Since the electron is negatively charged, its magnetic moment points opposite the angular momentum vector, its vector notation is: 

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{5}
\vec{\mu_{L}}=\frac{-e\vec{L}}{2m}
\end{align}
$$

From quantum mechanics, the magnitude of the angular momentum is
$\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar$, where $l$ is the angular quantum number. 
We observe then that the magnitude of $\mathbf{\mu}$ is also quantized:

$$
\begin{align}
    \tag{6}
     \boldsymbol{\mu_{L}}=\frac{e\hbar\sqrt{l(l+1)}}{2m_{e}}
\end{align}
$$

where $\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton denoted $\boldsymbol{\mu_B}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{7}
    \boldsymbol{\mu_L}=\boldsymbol{\mu_B}\sqrt{l(l+1)}
\end{align}
$$

We can also obtain the z-component of the orbital magnetic moment by relating it to the z-component of angular 
momentum, $L_z$ of magnitude $m_l\hbar$, where $m_l$ is the magnetic quantum number:

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{8}
    \boldsymbol{\mu_{z}}=-m_{l}\boldsymbol{\mu_{B}}
\end{align}
$$

We note that for an electron in a _s-orbital_ in a hydrogen atom, the electron does not generate an orbital magnetic moment. 
Indeed, recall that for a _s-orbital_, $l=0$. As a result, there will only be an orbital magnetic moment for an electron in orbitals with $l\geq 1$, $\left(p,d ...\right)$.
For instance, for an electron in a _p-orbital_, $l=1$, and $m_l=\left(-1,0,1\right)$. Hence we will get one total magnetic moment $\left(\sqrt{2}\mu_B\right)$, 
and three possible values for the z-component of the magnetic moment, corresponding to one of each _p-orbitals_.  

The fact that an electron in a _s-orbital_ does not have an angular magnetic moment suggests that an otherwise closed-shell atom with a single electron in a s-type valence shell 
should not have any preferential orientation when passing through a magnetic field. However, the Stern-Gerlach experiment showed such an atom (silver) passing through a magnetic field did orient itself with or against a magnetic field. This observation was experimental evidence that electrons had another magnetic moment
in addition to the orbital magnetic moment. Since the magnetic moment was understood with respect to a circular (angular to be more precise) type of motion, this "new" magnetic moment was also related to a "new" angular degree of freedom, the spin of the electron.

## Electron in a Magnetic Field
If we put a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, it will experience a torque given by the expression:

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{9}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}=\boldsymbol{\vec{\mu}}\times\vec{B}
\end{align}
$$

This torque will cause a change in angular momentum $\Delta l$ that is perpendicular to the 
angular momentum of the electron. 
This change in momentum will cause the electron to precess about the magnetic field. 
This precession is known as Larmor Precession. We can write the following expressions:

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{10}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}&=\frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}\\\
    \\
    \frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}&=\frac{l\sin{\theta}\Delta\phi}{\Delta t}\nonumber\\\
    \\
    \boldsymbol{\vec{\mu}}\times\vec{B}&=l\sin{\theta}\omega\nonumber\\\
    \\
    \frac{\boldsymbol{\mu_{B}}}{\hbar}Bl\sin{\theta}&=l\sin{\theta}\omega\nonumber\\\
    \\
    \omega&=\frac{\boldsymbol{\mu_{B}}}{\hbar}B\nonumber
\end{align}
$$

Here $\omega$ is known as the Larmor frequency.
Similar to orbital magnetic moment, 
electrons also possess a magnetic moment due to the spin angular momentum, 
known as the spin magnetic moment $\mu_{s}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{11}
    \vec{\mu_{s}}=\frac{-g_{s}\mu_{B}\vec{s}}{\hbar}\\
    \\
    \mu_{s_{z}}=-g_{s}\mu_{B}m_{s}
\end{align}
$$
