# Magnetic Moment of the Electron
We can develop an expression for the magnetic moment of the electron, by starting from the magnetic moment generated by a current loop.
The magnetic moment, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, is an indication of the 'strength' of the magnetic field generated by the current loop.
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is proportional to the number of loops $N$, the current $I$ going through the loop, and the area of the loop $A$. Hence, 
the units of the magnetic moments are amperes meter squared $[Am^2]$. We have the following relations:

$$
\begin{align}
    \tag{1}
     &\boldsymbol{\mu}=IA\\
    \tag{2}
     &A=\pi r^2\\
    \tag{3}
        &I=\frac{e}{t}
\end{align}
$$

If we want to look at the case of an electron going around a nucleus, we need a better expression for $I$ in this case. One that relates $I$ to the velocity of the electron, and the radius of its trajectory. 
Suppose the electron is going around the nucleus with velocity $v$, in a circular orbit 
Then the period $T$ is the time it takes to do one complete revolution $2\pi r$. 
Hence, $T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}$. 
So we can write $I=\frac{-ev}{2\pi r}$. 
If we recall the classical magnitude of angular momentum $L=mvr$. 
Putting everything together, we get the following expressions and the magnitude of magnetic moment:

$$
\begin{align}
    &I=\frac{ev}{2\pi r}\nonumber\\
    \\
    &\boldsymbol{\mu}=\frac{ev}{2\pi r}\pi r^2\nonumber\\
    \\
    \tag{4}
    &\boldsymbol{\mu_{L}}=\frac{eL}{2m}
\end{align}
$$

In vector notation, since the electron is negatively charged, its magnetic moment points opposite the angular momentum vector: 

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{5}
\vec{\mu_{L}}=\frac{-e\vec{L}}{2m}
\end{align}
$$

Using the fact from quantum mechanics that the magnitude of the angular momentum is
$\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar$, we can determine the quantum mechanical magnetic moment:

$$
\begin{align}
    \tag{6}
     \boldsymbol{\mu_{L}}=\frac{e\hbar\sqrt{l(l+1)}}{2m_{e}}
\end{align}
$$

The quantity $\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton denoted $\boldsymbol{\mu_B}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{7}
    \boldsymbol{\mu_L}=\boldsymbol{\mu_B}\sqrt{l(l+1)}
\end{align}
$$

The z-component of the orbital magnetic moment is given by the z-component of angular 
momentum (magnitude $m_l$)

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{8}
    \boldsymbol{\mu_{z}}=-m_{l}\boldsymbol{\mu_{B}}
\end{align}
$$

If we put a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, it will experience a torque given by the expression:

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{9}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}=\boldsymbol{\vec{\mu}}\times\vec{B}
\end{align}
$$

This torque will cause a change in angular momentum $\delta l$ that is perpendicular to the 
angular momentum of the electron. 
This change in momentum will cause the electron to precess about the magnetic field. 
This precession is known as Larmor Precession. We can write the following expressions:

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{10}
    \boldsymbol{\tau}&=\frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}\\\
    \\
    \frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}&=\frac{l\sin{\theta}\Delta\phi}{\Delta t}\nonumber\\\
    \\
    \boldsymbol{\vec{\mu}}\times\vec{B}&=l\sin{\theta}\omega\nonumber\\\
    \\
    \frac{\boldsymbol{\mu_{B}}}{\hbar}Bl\sin{\theta}&=l\sin{\theta}\omega\nonumber\\\
    \\
    \omega&=\frac{\boldsymbol{\mu_{B}}}{\hbar}B\nonumber
\end{align}
$$

Here $\omega$ is known as the Larmor frequency.
Similar to orbital magnetic moment, 
electrons also possess a magnetic moment due to the spin angular momentum, 
known as the spin magnetic moment $\mu_{s}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\tag{11}
    \vec{\mu_{s}}=\frac{-g_{s}\mu_{B}\vec{s}}{\hbar}\\
    \\
    \mu_{s_{z}}=-g_{s}\mu_{B}m_{s}
\end{align}
$$
