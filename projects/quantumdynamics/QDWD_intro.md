# Quantum Dynamics: A pedagogical tool

This page will, at first, be dedicated to discussing
the mathematica notebook published by professors [Beratan](https://beratanlab.chem.duke.edu/) and [Polizzi](https://www.polizzilab.org/) 
titled [Quantum Dynamics...With the Dynamics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00662).
Their notebook is a wonderfully pedagogical tool developed to 
teach certain aspects of quantum dynamics to students
aided with simulations and visualizations in mathematica. 
Using such a notebook, students are able to read about the
main concepts, and importantly, play with the simulations 
to gain a deeper understanding.  
In learning these concepts myself (from the notebook and other resources),
I am rewriting the simulations in python. It provides a fun
way to practice python while learning a subject that I am 
passionate about. Below you will find each of the
sections that I have already written in python
with my explanations if you would like to
read the code, and or just read about the dynamics.
