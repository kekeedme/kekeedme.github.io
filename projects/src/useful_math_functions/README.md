In this folder, I will keep some 
mathematical functions written in python. These
functions will mainly have the purpose of 
performing numerical approximations for one or
multiple calculations of interests. 

For instance, there will be a function that 
approximates the nth derivative of a user defined
function. This function can subsequently be used
by another function that will calculate the nth
Taylor approximation of a function as well. 

Since numerical calculations are approximations,
a lot of times due to the discretization of 
formulae that are exact when continuous, it will
be important for users to understand the inherent
errors present in the approximations used. I will
from time to time discuss our such errors occur
and/or write functions that can estimate errors
for a particular approximation.
